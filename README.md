# KKA Final Project

## Introduction
In today's fast-paced world, deciding where to eat can often be a time-consuming process. Whether it's choosing between different types of cuisine, balancing budget constraints, or finding a location that's convenient for everyone, the challenge of picking a restaurant that satisfies all criteria can become overwhelming. To address this issue, we propose a Restaurant Recommendation System that utilizes advanced search algorithms to provide personalized, optimal restaurant suggestions based on user preferences, location, and other key factors. By leveraging methods such as informed search, local search, and constraint satisfaction, this system aims to simplify the decision-making process, delivering recommendations that are both efficient and tailored to individual or group needs.

## Background
When individuals or groups plan to eat out, there will always debate in choosing where they want to eat due to the vary preferences of itselfs. They must also consider the constraints such as budget, approximated cost, travel to distance, operational hours and many more. The abundance amount of restaurant options merge with how limited time and varying preferences create this problem.
Hence, in here we develop a Restaurant Recommendation system to help people that still in sea and want to choose their preferences of restaurant quickly. By using search methodology such as Uninformed, Informed, Local, and Adversarial search.

## Problem Statement
Generally, when an individual or group of people wants to eat out, they often face difficulty choosing a restaurant that matches their preferences, budget, and location. This problem becomes more complex when there are multiple people with different preferences, such as:<br>
- Type of cuisine (e.g., healthy food, fast food, traditional food)
- Available budget
- Restaurant location
- Ratings or reviews from previous customers 
<br>
This recommendation system aims to solve this problem by offering restaurant options that meet the preferences of multiple users in a single search.

## Uniqueness
#### 1. Multiple User Preferences
When several people are involved, each with their own food preferences, budget, and location, the system can combine and balance these multiple preferences to provide a recommendation that satisfies the majority of users. This is particularly useful for situations like family outings, group lunches, or meetings where diverse preferences must be considered. Not only for that, individuals can involve themself in this system too, of course. 
#### 2. Distance and time efficiency calculation
By leveraging search algorithms like A* search, the system can prioritize nearby restaurants that minimize travel time, which is crucial for users with limited time, such as lunch breaks. It ensures that the recommendation not only fits the food preferences but also accounts for time efficiency. 
#### 3. Quick decision-making
This recommendation system uses a combination of uninformed, informed, and local search algorithms to find optimal solutions. Algorithms like A* help find the best routes to nearby restaurants and can be used to refine restaurant choices based on the users' preferences, adjusting for cost, location, and group size. By using multiple algorithms, the system ensures both speed and accuracy in producing recommendations.

## Methodology
For our project, we have chosen to develop a Restaurant Recommendation System. With the vast number of dining options available, finding the perfect restaurant that matches a userâ€™s preferences can be a challenging task. Our system aims to address this by intelligently recommending restaurants based on key factors such as location, cuisine, price range, and user reviews. By employing advanced search algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS), A Search*, and Genetic Algorithms, our system can provide users with personalized, optimal dining recommendations that best suit their tastes and needs.
